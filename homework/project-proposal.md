#Final Project Proposal

##The Problem 

**Karaoke Synch** is the process of creating karaoke by syncing the lyrics with the music. To allow the performer to sing along, the words need to be highlighted as they should be sung. 

This process is manual. There are many tools available to help you create a karaoke, but they all involve an extreme amount of manual intervention and the process of creating one 3 minute song karaoke could take at least 2 hours. 

##The Objective

The objective of my project is to be able to automatically create a karaoke given the lyrics text and the music file. I believe the use of machine learning algorithms can solve this problem. It would involve predicting which word in the lyric match with which part of the song's vocals.

##Dataset

The training data used for this project would be: 

1.	mp3 files of most popular songs within the last 5 years - can be downloaded from iTunes or Spotify

2.	mp3 files converted to format for audio analysis - can use EchoNest APIs to do this

3.	lyrics to the songs in question as text files - can be downloaded from http://lyricfind.com/

4. Manual lyric synchronized data that I will create for these songs in question for use as target variables (dependent variables)

##Motivation for choosing this project

I was interested in building karaoke for Afrobeats songs (West African Music). However unlike popular western music, it is impossible to find karaoke versions of these songs. I thought about building them manually using the tools available online but this would require significant resources and time. If there was a way to do this automatically, karaoke can be built at scale. This can also be used for many other applications such as: 

**Gaming:** Guitar Hero / Rock Band - can help reduce the time to sync lyrics with music and as a result reduce game development time

**Karaoke outlets:** Many of them have only old songs because of the time it takes to make karaoke and add it to their database. With this solution, they would be able to add songs to their database quickly and have the latest songs. As a result, increasing their customer base.

**Non-english karaoke:** Karaoke is dominated by only ENglish and Chinese songs. This solution would create an opportunity for people to create karaoke in any language, for any song!

This will be really tough, but I am determined... Good luck to me!
