## Setup checklist

This is a checklist to confirm that your laptop is set up properly for DAT19. If at any point you get an error message, please note the error message and we will help you to fix it! If you don't get any error messages, you are properly set up.

Please post a message in the "setupchecklist" channel in Slack once you have walked through the entire checklist. That way, we will know whether or not we need to follow up with you.


### Installation and Setup
* Install the [Anaconda distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads) of Python 2.7x.
* Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
* Once you receive an email invitation from [Slack](https://slack.com/), join our team and add your photo!

### Python
* While still at the command line:
    * Type `conda list` (if you choose not to use Anaconda, this will generate an error)
    * Type `python` to open the Python interpreter
* While in the Python interpreter:
    * Look at the Python version number. It should start with 2.7.
    * Type `import pandas`
    * Type `exit()` to exit the interpreter. You can now close the command line application.
